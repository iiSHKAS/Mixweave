# Changelog

This file summarizes user-visible changes in each release. Entries describe
the project under whichever name it carried at the time (Sonux through
1.2.0; Mixweave from the next release onward).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.1] - 08/10/2026

### Languages

- Added bundled Arabic (with right-to-left layout), Russian and Simplified
  Chinese translations. Mixweave now follows the system language by default and
  falls back to English for anything untranslated.
- Custom language packs can still override any bundled translation key by key.

### Mixer

- Removed the "Listen" button from every channel's settings page except the
  microphone, and from the Master personal lane. Channels already play on their
  own output, so it only duplicated what you hear.
- Microphone mute buttons now double as listen buttons: tap to mute or unmute,
  press and hold to hear the processed mic (the icon becomes headphones). In
  Streamer Mode the Personal and Stream lanes listen independently.

### Linux

- Fixed GNOME/Wayland global shortcuts not firing when the executable's path
  contains a space.

### Microphone

- Added AI noise suppression (RNNoise) with a strength control, and acoustic
  echo cancellation (WebRTC AEC3) for speaker users, both under the
  microphone's Processing section. Both are off by default and add about 10 ms
  of delay; they run ahead of the EQ, so the gate, compressor, and both output
  legs work on the cleaned signal.
- Slider ranges now stop at 100% unless amplification is allowed per slider.

## [1.2.0] - 31/08/2026

Sonux 1.2.0 improves first-run guidance, application identity, localization,
and audio startup behavior.

### Interface and onboarding

- Redesigned and polished the mixer, application, profile, processing, and
  settings interfaces with more consistent spacing, controls, explanations,
  focus behavior, and responsive layouts.
- Replaced the abstract onboarding diagram with a five-step first-run tour
  containing faithful miniature previews of the mixer, app routing, profiles,
  and microphone processing.
- Added a final onboarding choice between the ready-made Game, Chat, Media,
  and Aux board and a minimal custom starting board. The tour can be replayed
  from Settings without changing the current setup.
- Improved startup synchronization so transient frontend/backend timing does
  not leave the interface permanently disconnected after Sonux is available.

### Applications and languages

- Resolved related PipeWire streams to a canonical desktop application.
  Routing, hiding, drag-and-drop, and inactive-history operations now act on
  the complete group while preserving strict backend validation.
- Improved desktop-file and Steam identity resolution, including helpers that
  share launchers or reveal additional stream identities later.
- Added optional JSON language packs under
  `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sonux/locales`, with system-language selection, safe
  validation, CLDR plural forms, right-to-left support, English fallback, and
  an included custom-pack template.

### Audio routing and reliability

- Added an acknowledged WirePlumber 0.5 pre-link policy. Remembered streams
  now select their Sonux channel before their first playback link instead of
  briefly reaching the physical output at full stream volume.
- Confirmed the fix live with Brave returning after its PipeWire stream had
  disappeared: playback began at the configured Media volume without the
  previous onset spike.
- Preserved a safe fallback when Sonux channels are unavailable, excluded
  ignored applications from pre-link routing, and kept assignment, profile,
  channel-removal, and factory-reset metadata transactions coherent.
- Smoothed native processing after idle boundaries by discarding only stale
  buffered samples, resetting DSP state, and applying a short stereo-aligned
  resume fade.
- Fixed application restart so the old graph and route metadata are torn down
  before the replacement initializes.

### Upgrade notes

- The WirePlumber hook is installed automatically on first launch. Until the
  next login or WirePlumber service restart, Sonux safely uses its existing
  live-router fallback. No manual routing-file edits are required.
- Existing settings, assignments, profiles, and backups remain compatible.
- PipeWire with PulseAudio compatibility and WirePlumber 0.5 or newer remain
  required.

## [1.1.1] - 29/08/2026

Sonux 1.1.1 is a maintenance update with no intended audio or interface
behavior changes.

### Maintenance

- Restored clean builds under Rust 1.98 by adopting the equivalent slice
  chunking API available since the project's Rust 1.88 minimum.
- Updated Material Symbols, Zustand, Vite's React plugin, Vite, and Vitest to
  their reviewed minor or patch releases.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-13

Sonux 1.1.0 expands profile, microphone, metering, and recovery support while
strengthening the native PipeWire audio path introduced in earlier releases.

### Highlights

- Manage complete audio profiles: create fresh setups, copy, rename, delete,
  search, and activate profiles from the Profiles screen. Sonux retains an
  automatically protected fallback profile.
- Switch profiles automatically when a linked application starts or an
  assigned output device appears.
- Create and restore configuration backups. Sonux creates a recovery backup
  before replacing the active configuration.
- Optionally publish up to four independently processed microphone channels,
  each with its own input, gain, EQ, gate, compressor, limiter, mute, and
  profile state. This requires the native PipeWire backend.
- View live dBFS meters with peak and clip indicators, and choose the refresh
  rate or turn meter animation off. This requires the native PipeWire backend.
- Create stereo or spatial 7.1 custom channels and configure default devices,
  output failover, and Sonux device-label styles.
- Use improved keyboard controls, focus handling, accessible labels, dialogs,
  and explanatory tooltips throughout the mixer.

### Reliability and compatibility

- Hardened audio graph updates and recovery when PipeWire nodes, ports, links,
  or input devices disappear and return.
- Prevented unsafe microphone self-routing and made follow-default microphones
  choose only valid physical inputs.
- Removed unbounded real-time parameter waits and protected capture processing
  from invalid buffer offsets and concurrent ring-buffer overwrites.
- Made profile and configuration writes atomic, strictly validated, and
  serialized with backup, restore, and factory-reset operations.
- Preserved malformed or older profile data for recovery and added migration
  for legacy secondary microphone names.
- Made profile switching refresh the interface from one coherent backend
  snapshot, preventing mixed state during overlapping manual and automatic
  switches.
- Added source-controlled PipeWire binding compatibility patches for Clang 22
  while retaining the required upstream MIT notices.

### Upgrade notes

- Existing settings and profiles are migrated automatically. Creating a manual
  backup in Settings before upgrading is still recommended.
- Multiple microphone channels and live meters require the native PipeWire
  backend. The `pactl` fallback remains available with reduced functionality.
- PipeWire with PulseAudio compatibility and WirePlumber 0.5 or newer remain
  required.
- Runtime testing is confirmed on CachyOS and Arch Linux. Other distributions
  and package formats listed in the README are intended targets, not verified
  compatibility.
