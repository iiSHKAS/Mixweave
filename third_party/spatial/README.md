# Mixweave spatial audio data

Mixweave embeds one audited Aalto University SOFA dataset for its production
7.1-to-binaural renderer. No optional comparison engines or development
binaries are included in this repository.

The repository contains only the required 1.4 MB low-frequency-extended SOFA
file and its attribution. Its metadata reports 48 kHz FIR data, 196 source
positions, two receivers, 512 samples per impulse response, and four measured
radii: 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 metres. The low-frequency extension crosses to a
rigid-sphere model at 500 Hz.

The libmysofa 1.3.4 validator returns error 10012 when opening this 2023
dataset directly because it expresses `ReceiverPosition` in spherical rather
than Cartesian coordinates. Mixweave converts the loaded in-memory structure to
Cartesian coordinates and validates it before constructing the production
lookup and interpolation tables. The tracked SOFA file itself is not changed.

The production build embeds `runtime/NF_LIB_HRTF_LFE.sofa`; the tracked copy
must retain the SHA-256 listed above.

## Verify the dataset

```sh
sha256sum third_party/spatial/runtime/NF_LIB_HRTF_LFE.sofa
```

Any mismatch means the file should not be used until its origin and contents
have been checked again.
